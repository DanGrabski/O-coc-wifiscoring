Raspberry Pi 2
----
The first year this project was run on a dedicated laptop on a recent ubuntu build. 
This year to save on space and power, one investment is to set up the project to run on a raspberry pi 2.

The steps below were successful in October 2015 to bring up the project on this new hardware.

0. Install raspbian and bring up your pi2.
1. Update the package manager
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
2. Install Node.js from an external repo
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
3. Install mongodb for ARM.  
MongoDB doesn't actually support ARM. I used the pre-compiled files made available for download on this page: <https://facat.github.io/cross-compile-mongodb-for-arm.html> Download, move the files into ```/bin/``` and mark as executable.   
*(You should be thinking "Isn't that dangerous?" and the short answer is "Yes!" Cross compile from source if you know what you're doing.)*
4. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ercjns/O-coc-wifiscoring.git <destination>
```
5. Move to the proejct folder and install dependencies for the server.
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
6. Create a folder for mongo to store data.
```bash
mkdir data
cd data
mkdir db
cd ../..
```
7. Start the mongo service
```bash
sudo mongod --datapath ./data/db
```
8. Run the Node.js server
```bash
sudo npm start
```
9. If you're feeling lucky, visit ```localhost```
